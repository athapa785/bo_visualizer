Bayesian Optimization Model Visualization Tool

This PyQt5-based tool provides an interactive interface to visualize generator models commonly used in Bayesian Optimization. By selecting variables, setting reference points, and choosing to display the acquisition function, users can gain valuable insights into the model's behavior and decision-making process.

Key Features:

Visual Model Exploration: Easily explore how the generator model's predictions change with different variable values.

Reference Point Customization: Set reference points for unselected variables to create focused visualizations.

Acquisition Function Insight: Optionally display the acquisition function to understand how the model chooses the next optimization point.
